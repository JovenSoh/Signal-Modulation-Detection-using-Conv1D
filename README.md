# Signal Modulation Detection using Conv1D
 Classification of signals based on its modulation

## Overview
The jupyter notebook generates signals modulated with Bi-Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM). <br>

Modulation | Characteristics
-----------|-----------------
BPSK       |Change in phase of signal by a magnitude of pi 
LFM        |Constant change in frequency

The neural network will learn to classify 3 different input signals, Continuous Wave (CW), BPSK and LFM. <br>

## Dependencies
Pandas <br>
Numpy <br>
Scipy <br>
Matplotlib <br>
Keras <br>
Sklearn <br>
